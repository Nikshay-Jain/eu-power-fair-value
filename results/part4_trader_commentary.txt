**Daily DE-LU Power Market Briefing - 2026-01-14**

Good morning team, our models are generating a strong **LONG** signal for the DE-LU power market for today, 2026-01-14. The fair value (P50) is estimated at 89.53 EUR/MWh, significantly above the current forward price of 75.0 EUR/MWh. This indicates a substantial potential edge of 14.53 EUR/MWh, suggesting the market is currently underpricing the expected spot value.

The primary drivers behind this upward price prediction are centered around conventional generation requirements and system fundamentals. The model highlights `residual_load_mw` as the most significant factor, indicating a tight balance between demand and non-dispatchable supply, necessitating increased reliance on thermal generation. This is further supported by the strong influence of `Fossil Brown coal/Lignite`, `Other`, `Fossil Hard coal`, and `Fossil Gas` in the top five drivers, collectively pointing to a scenario where higher-cost or constrained fossil fuel generation is expected to set the marginal price.

Our confidence in this signal is exceptionally high, with a win probability of 96.7%. This robust output is derived from our latest analysis, with detailed feature importance available in 'part2_feature_importance.csv' and the full trading signals outlined in 'part3_trading_signals.csv'. We recommend evaluating long positions given these strong indicators.
